# Political Compass Test LLM (Large Language Model) Utility

A utility for running tests on language models to evaluate their political bias. It supports both [classic](https://www.politicalcompass.org/) and [eightvalues](https://8values.github.io/) tests with various options, along with a specialized left-right bias evaluation test. There is also a `character` test for the classic test which prompts the LLM to act as each of the quadrant and averages the answers to try to uncover bias. Uses the [llama-cpp-python](https://github.com/abetlen/llama-cpp-python) library for calling the LLM.
